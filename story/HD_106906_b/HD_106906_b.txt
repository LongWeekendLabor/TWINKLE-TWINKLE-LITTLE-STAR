The spacecraft seems to have information on this planet, which is called HD 106906 b.

The documentation says he's a planet, but I haven't found his star near here.

But surprisingly, the data on the spacecraft told me that the planet was 300 light-years away from its parent star.

And no one knew why he was so far away from his parent star.

The planet is also a gas giant and appears to be the furthest known star from its parent star.

He is also the only planet in the star HD 106906.

But what's interesting is that after people on Earth discovered this star, they seemed to want to name it "Gallifrey" after the planet where the protagonist lives in a TV series.
