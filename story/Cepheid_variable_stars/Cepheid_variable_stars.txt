"There are many, many stars in the universe that are constantly emitting light.

Whenever the light of a star flickers, it is called a variable star.

"This is what I read on the spacecraft.Among them, Cepheids are even more special.

They will brighten or dim periodically, and each time the brightness is higher, his period will be longer.

Because this type of variable star is very regular in brightness, it can also be used as a measure of distance in the universe.

If you want to know the distance of a galaxy, you must first find the Cepheid variable stars in this galaxy.

Knowing the stars indirectly through incredible ways, sometimes I wonder, can I deduce the position of the earth from this knowledge?
