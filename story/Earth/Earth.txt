Is this Earth?

It is different from those stars I have seen.

Because the environment is very stable for spices, gradually developing a such civilization.

Looking at this planet, there are so many thing I have never seen before.

Can I meet the ship creator who passionate about the space?

While I am thinking, a ship lands on the hill.

Because the revolution and rotation of the planet, the sunlight can't shine here. It seems to be called night.

At this moment,  a record launches in the space.

"The lifespan of human is so short that yearning for the universe is a luxury."

"But, I want to know how it feels to see the starry sky after my space travel."

I finally can understand why someone love universe so much

If I could always look up and see this starry sky, I would definitely be unable to extricate myself.

Space travel takes too long, so we want to hear from people who have traveled.

The time of a lifespan of human is even ignorable in the space.

Although that feeling of regret and loss that cannot witness the change.

I want to know all of universe, perhaps this is the fascination of it.
