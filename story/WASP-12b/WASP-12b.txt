The planet is called WASP-12b.

He is the least dense of the known exoplanets, and not only that, he is also very dark.

It's so dark because WASP-12b's surface absorbs 94 percent of light radiation.

It is also called "Black Asphalt" because its appearance is as pitch-black as pitch.

However, since he is very close to the star, he is likely to have been swallowed up by his own star, WASP-12, while observing him now, right?
