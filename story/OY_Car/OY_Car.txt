The star observed this time is called OY Carinae by the spacecraft.

His appearance is very special, to be precise, they are composed of two stars, like twins.

OY Carinae is classified as a Cataclysmic variable star (CV), which is easy to spot because they are mostly sky blue.

They orbit each other almost every two hours, which can be said to be changing very rapidly in the universe.

The two stars influence each other in a complex, yet delicate balance.

Everything in the universe seems to be like this, complex but stable.
