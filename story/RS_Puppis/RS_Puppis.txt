During the long float, I looked out the window, expecting something new to happen in front of me. 

After a while, sure enough, a very bright star appeared in my eyes. 

And this star is recognized by the spacecraft as RS Puppis, a supergiant star. 

Because of the pulsations, it changes in size and surface temperature, and its brightness changes with them. 

Its maximum apparent magnitude is +6.52 and its minimum is +7.67. 

In this type of variable star, it also has a variable light period of up to 41.5 days, 

and it is the longest period in this type of variable star.
