I've always felt that nothing in the universe can compare to the shock.

I feel when I see something I've never seen before.

Traveling for a long time will not feel any boring, as if the universe has satisfied all my curiosity with countless suprise.

And the spaceship that led me to this place always made me know more about everything in the universe by asking questions.

Sometimes I can't help but wonder, how exactly is the knowledge on the spacecraft?
