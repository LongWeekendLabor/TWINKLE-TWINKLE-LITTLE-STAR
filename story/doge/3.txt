According to my current speculation, the earth should be the place where the person who built the spacecraft lived, and all the knowledge on the spacecraft was observed from the perspective of the earth.

It was as if he had never left Earth once.

If you can understand the universe from different perspectives, you will have different feelings, which is what I learned while traveling.

Since you can build spaceships and love the universe, why not leave the earth and take a look?
