I drive this spacecraft is called N273.

While I don't know exactly where this ship came from, it's pretty incredible.

The ship has a lot of knowledge in the universe and leads me to explore the secrets in the universe.

The more time I spend in the universe, the spaceship seems to peek into the universe through me bit by bit, and guide me to find something.

Over time, you will naturally have feelings for the vast universe.

And I am also more and more curious about the destination that this ship wants to take me to.
