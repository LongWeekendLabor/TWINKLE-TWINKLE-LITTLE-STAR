In the long universe, a red light suddenly burst out in the endless night, and the culprit of this red burst is called Monocerotis in the book.

I tried this to rummage around for him, and the book says:

A large explosion was observed before, and probably became one of the largest stars we know of in a very short time after the explosion.

Originally thought to be is a typical nova eruption and was later identified as the first of a new class of exploding variable stars known as luminous red novae.

The cause of the eruption remains uncertain, but several conjectures have been proposed, including an eruption related to the star's death process and mergers of binary stars or planets.

By 2009 the temperature of the supergiant had increased (since 2005) to 3,270 K and its luminosity was 15,000 times solar, but its radius had decreased to 380 times that of the Sun.

So I thought that the universe is not always in a stable state.
