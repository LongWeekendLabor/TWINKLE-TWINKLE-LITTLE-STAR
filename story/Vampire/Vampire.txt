The star observed this time was called the Vampire star by the spacecraft.

Their appearance is very special, to be precise, they are composed of two stars.

Vampire stars are classified as Cataclysmic variable stars (CVs), a type of variable that may appear in two-star systems, one of which is the end product of life in a Sun-like star or a white dwarf.

Another is when these white dwarfs devour their companions' material like vampires, causing a big explosion.
